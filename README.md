# Task Management API

This is a Flask-based API for managing tasks. It uses SQLAlchemy and psycopg2 to interact with a PostgreSQL database. You can use Postman to test the API endpoints. To get started, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, create a virtual environment (optional), activate it, and install the required packages: Flask, SQLAlchemy, and psycopg2. Next, set up a PostgreSQL database and create a "tasks" table with the specified columns. Update the database configuration in the `app.py` file. The API provides endpoints for retrieving all tasks, creating a new task, retrieving a specific task, updating a specific task, and deleting a specific task. Start the Flask development server and use Postman to send requests to the corresponding endpoints to test the API. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under MIT.
